      <h2> Mission Statement </h2>
      Hi! My name is Brittaney Pertsas, and I am going into my 3rd year of college as a French Horn Performance major. I didn't start
      seriously pursuing music until my junior year of high school, so I was a little bit behind in finding schools, summer programs, and
      just knowing how to record for auditions in general. It is my goal to not only promote myself through my website, but to also
      post about summer music festivals and post more information about the horn that I wish I figured out while I was still in high school.
